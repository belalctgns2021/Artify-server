## ⚙️ Setup Instructions


2. Install Dependencies

3. Configure Environment Variables


💡 Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your actual MongoDB Atlas URI.
It’s highly recommended not to hardcode credentials in your code.

Then, update your connection code in server.js to:
const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI;

4. Start the Server
npm start

Server will start on:
http://localhost:3000
